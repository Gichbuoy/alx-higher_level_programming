### Test-driven development (TDD) 
- is a software development practice that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. TDD follows a cycle of writing a failing test, writing the minimum amount of code to make the test pass, and then refactoring the code to improve its design while keeping the tests passing. The goal of TDD is to ensure that the code is thoroughly tested and meets the desired specifications.

- In Python, you can practice test-driven development using various testing frameworks such as unittest, pytest, and doctest. Here's a general outline of how to approach test-driven development in Python:

* Write a Test: Begin by writing a test that specifies the desired behavior of the code. Tests in Python are typically written as functions using an appropriate testing framework. Define test cases that cover different scenarios and expected outcomes.

* Run the Test: Execute the test(s) to verify that they fail. This step ensures that the tests are valid and accurately reflect the desired behavior.

* Write the Code: Implement the code necessary to pass the test. Start with the minimum amount of code needed to satisfy the test cases.

* Run the Test Again: Execute the tests to check if they pass. The goal is to have all the test cases pass without any failures.
	- The tests should now pass since the code has been implemented to fulfill the desired behavior.

* Refactor and Repeat: Refactor the code to improve its design, readability, and performance while ensuring that the tests continue to pass. The tests act as a safety net, providing confidence that the changes made during refactoring haven't introduced any regressions.

* Repeat the Cycle: Continue the cycle of writing tests, implementing code, running tests, and refactoring until the desired functionality is achieved, and the code is well-tested and maintainable.
