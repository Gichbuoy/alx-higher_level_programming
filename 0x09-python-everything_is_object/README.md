### Objects and values  in python


- In Python, objects and values are fundamental concepts that play a significant role in understanding how the language works. Let's take a closer look at each of these concepts:

* Objects: In Python, everything is an object. An object is a specific instance of a particular class. It can be a built-in data type (e.g., integers, strings, lists) or a user-defined class. Each object has its own identity, type, and value.

* Identity: The identity of an object is a unique identifier that distinguishes it from other objects. You can think of it as the address of the object in memory. The built-in id() function can be used to retrieve the identity of an object.

* Type: The type of an object defines the set of operations that can be performed on that object and determines its behavior. Python provides several built-in types, such as int, float, str, list, dict, etc. You can use the type() function to check the type of an object.

* Value: The value of an object represents the data it holds. It can be a number, a string, a list of items, or any other valid data. The value of an object may be mutable (changeable) or immutable (unchangeable), depending on the type. For example, strings and tuples are immutable, while lists and dictionaries are mutable.

- Python variables are used to refer to objects. When you assign a value to a variable, it actually binds the variable to the object. Multiple variables can be bound to the same object, and changes made to one variable may affect others if they refer to the same object.
