### Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

* Lists - is a mutable(possible to change its content) collection of items, denoted by square brackets []
	- can hold any type of data, including other lists.
		eg: my_list = [1, 2, 3, "four", [5, 6]]

* Tuples - is an immutable collection of items denoted by brackets ()
	- can hold any type of data including other tuples.
		eg: my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "four", (5, 6))
